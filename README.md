# Password Generator Starter Code

# Description
This repository provides a working password generator for 8 to 128 characters. The types of characters included can be lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters. Upon clicking "Generate Password" there are a series of questions asking what you would prefer in your password. The length of the password is an entry and is restricted to whole numbers from 8 to 128. Any decimals, strings, or numbers outside this range will result in an alert asking you to re-enter your selection. Then there are a series of confirm questions pertaining to which characters are desired in the password, if none are selected an alert will indicate as such and you will be asked the questions again. After all questions have been answered the generator will produce a password that can be copied.
